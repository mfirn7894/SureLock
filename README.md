My first apartment in New York City was a tiny 4th floor walkup in the heart of Chinatown. The place had character, but I quickly ran into an issue that I had never encountered in college or suburban Massachusetts – I couldn’t receive packages at my apartment. What good is 2-day shipping if the deliveryman can’t get through the door?

For the majority of tenants who can’t afford an upscale apartment attended by a doorman, package delivery and receipt of services is inconvenient and difficult for residents to manage. Leaving doors unlocked or packages on a stoop are unsafe and unsecure options. Providing keys or long-term access codes to delivery personnel would be a cumbersome process that requires an infrastructure build-out that most businesses, especially inflexible large mail delivery organizations, would be unwilling to make.

Using an Arduino computer, a PHP- and HTML-based UI, and Python back-end functionality, I developed a secure package delivery and storage system that can create, manage, and validate random one-time-use numeric passcodes, as well as notify residents when their packages have arrived. 

This technology has applications beyond packages. Code validity could be specified on a timed basis, allowing residents to grant a serviceman access to the building within, say, a two-hour window to fix a leaky pipe. AirBnB hosts could assign guests temporary access codes that remain valid for the length of their stay. Long-term access could be provided to recurring visitors, with the option to revoke access at any point. No need to change your locks after a breakup or a break-in. Imagine embarking on a weeklong vacation and being able to provide a unique code to your neighbor who has (reluctantly) agreed to feed your cat.

I’m a self-taught amateur programmer with undoubtedly sloppy and inefficient code. Suggestions welcome!
